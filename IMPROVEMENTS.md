# Disc-to-Digital Roadmap (CDs, DVDs, Blu‑rays)

Goal: Build a reliable, mostly automated pipeline to transfer disc-based media you own (for local, personal use) into clean, well-tagged digital files ready for a future media server.

## Recent Major Updates (December 2025)

### 🎵 Music Genre Tagging System Overhaul
- **Genre metadata tagging (`bin/update-genre-mb.py`)** - Complete rewrite with advanced features:
  - **Christmas content auto-detection** - Automatically tags Christmas-related content as "christmas" genre
  - **Genre transformers** - Maps common variants to whitelist entries (e.g., "rhythm and blues" → "r&b")
  - **Comprehensive whitelist** - 100+ curated genres across all major music families
  - **Additive rejected genres logging** - Preserves existing entries, removes duplicates
  - **`--force-missing` flag** - Only update files without existing genre tags
  - **Improved API reliability** - 15s timeout, 4 retries with exponential backoff
  - **Smart genre selection** - Prioritizes core genres over decades/subjective tags
  - **Unresolved files logging** - Records files with no genre found for manual review
- **Manual genre tagging (`bin/tag-manual-genre.py`)** - NEW script for manual genre assignment:
  - **Whitelist validation** - Uses same curated whitelist as automatic script
  - **Genre transformers** - Applies same transformations for consistency
  - **Bulk operations** - Single files, folders, or recursive processing
  - **Safe operation** - Dry-run mode and force options for control
  - **Robust import system** - Uses importlib to handle hyphenated filenames
  - **Real-time validation** - Immediate feedback on genre validity

### 📺 TV Show Metadata Enhancement  
- **Show metadata tagging (`bin/tag-show-metadata.py`)** - Advanced override system:
  - **Manual ID overrides** - `--tmdb-id` and `--imdb-id` flags for problematic shows
  - **Automatic override system** - `log/show_tmdb_overrides.json` for persistent fixes
  - **IMDb fallback via OMDb** - Handles shows deleted from TMDb
  - **Filename correction** - Fixes macOS colon-to-dash conversion in episode titles
  - **Verbose logging** - Shows exactly which metadata source is being used

### 🎄 Christmas Content Detection
- **Automatic Christmas genre tagging** across all music processing scripts
- **Comprehensive term detection** - christmas, xmas, noel, holiday, santa, carol, jingle, etc.
- **Classic carol recognition** - silent night, joy to the world, hark the herald, etc.
- **Priority handling** - Christmas genre takes precedence over other detected genres

### 🔄 Genre Transformer System
- **Smart genre normalization** - Maps variants to standardized whitelist entries:
  - **R&B variants** - "rhythm & blues", "rnb", "r and b" → "rhythm and blues"
  - **Classical variants** - "symphony orchestra" → "classical"
  - **Latin variants** - "guaguancó" → "afro-cuban" (Cuban rumba style)
  - **Whitelist protection** - Never transforms already-valid whitelisted genres
- **Enhanced whitelist** - Added "rhythm and blues" alongside "r&b" for proper naming
- **Cleaned duplicate entries** - Removed "blues", "avant-garde", "minimalism", "musical" duplicates
- **Fixed categorization** - Properly assigned "ska", "world", "latin jazz" to correct families
- **Rejected genres cleanup** - Removed valid genres with transformations from rejected list

### 🛑 Signal Handling & Graceful Shutdown
- **Dual-level Ctrl+C handling** - First press graceful shutdown, second press force exit
- **API call interruption** - Checks shutdown flags during MusicBrainz API calls and retry delays
- **Responsive interruption** - No more hanging on long network operations
- **Progress preservation** - Graceful shutdown saves cache and progress before exit
- **Force escape hatch** - Second Ctrl+C provides immediate termination if needed

### 📝 Logging and Cache Improvements
- **Additive rejected genres** - Preserves existing entries across script runs
- **Duplicate removal** - Only stores unique genre names (no artist/album examples)
- **Improved cache handling** - Better timeout and retry logic for reliable API calls
- **Smart cache bypassing** - Force modes bypass cache for untagged files to ensure fresh lookups
- **Real-time unresolved file logging** - Files with no genre appear in log immediately for manual review
- **Fresh log reset** - Each run starts with clean unresolved files log (no accumulation)
- **Historical preservation** - Maintains audit trail of genre improvements

## Current capabilities (from this repo)
- `.abcde.conf` — solid CD ripping config to FLAC with MusicBrainz lookup, M3U playlists, filename sanitization, and a post-encode eject hook.
- `fix_album.sh` — album-level normalization using MusicBrainz track titles, renames to `NN - Title.flac`, creates playlist, then runs tag + cover-art fixes.
- `fix_album_covers.sh` — fills in missing `cover.jpg` (1000×1000) via Cover Art Archive.
- `fix_metadata.py` — validates and (optionally) fixes `TITLE/ARTIST/ALBUM/TRACKNUMBER` based on `NN - Title.flac` and folder structure.
- `fix_track.py` — organizes a single loose track using tags/AcoustID/MusicBrainz → `Artist/Album/NN - Title.ext`.
- `compare_music.py` — fast fuzz-based comparison of two libraries; can group by artist/album or emit difference files.
- `bin/tag-explicit-mb.py` — per-track explicit tagging (`EXPLICIT=Yes|No|Unknown`) using manual overrides (`explicit_overrides.csv`) + iTunes + MusicBrainz; supports both FLAC (CD rips) and MP3 (digital purchases); includes incremental mode and track-search fallback, `--verbose` output control, and optional playlist generation. Note: iTunes data is incomplete for older albums—use overrides for known false negatives.
- `bin/tag-movie-metadata.py` — tags MP4 files with rich movie metadata (title/year/plot/genres/director/cast/rating/artwork) via TMDb/OMDb using IMDb ID (and supports title/year search).
- `bin/sync-library.py` — rsync-based sync helper that can exclude `EXPLICIT=Yes` and/or `EXPLICIT=Unknown` from a destination library; supports both FLAC and MP3 files; includes automatic cleanup of empty directories, enhanced progress reporting, and playlist fixing for missing tracks.
- `custom-sync/master-sync.py` — orchestrates multiple sync jobs from YAML config with intelligent global delete mode; automatically runs explicit tagging before each sync to ensure new content is properly flagged; features two-phase sync (sync all jobs, then global cleanup) and target-specific deletion logic.
- `_install/` — installers to set up core dependencies and fix a known abcde issue on macOS.
- `prince-lovesexy/split_lovesexy.sh` — example special-case splitter for a single-file album.

## Phase 1 — Harden the CD pipeline ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: Core pipeline implemented with advanced genre tagging system.

### Completed features:
- ✅ **Advanced genre tagging system** (`bin/update-genre-mb.py`)
  - Comprehensive whitelist with 100+ curated genres
  - Christmas content auto-detection with priority handling
  - Genre transformers for variant normalization
  - Smart API handling with improved timeouts and retries
  - Additive rejected genres logging with duplicate removal
  - Multiple processing modes (normal, force, force-missing)
- ✅ ReplayGain and loudness:
  - Keep using `USERPLAYGAIN=y` for tagging. Consider an optional step to write album/track ReplayGain tags for consistent playback.
- ✅ Accurate ripping and verification:
  - Ensure secure reading with `cdparanoia` settings in `.abcde.conf`.
  - Save abcde and cdparanoia logs per album for auditability.
  - Generate per-album checksums (`SHA256SUMS`) after rip and after any metadata changes.
- ✅ Metadata fidelity:
  - Persist the chosen MusicBrainz release ID (e.g., write `MUSICBRAINZ_ALBUMID` / `MUSICBRAINZ_RELEASEGROUPID`) so re-runs are deterministic.
  - Add `DISCTOTAL`/`DISCNUMBER` where applicable; improve handling of `Various Artists`.
- ✅ Cover art:
  - Standardize external `cover.jpg` at 1000×1000.
  - Optional: embed the cover into each FLAC (`metaflac --import-picture-from`) while also keeping `cover.jpg` for media servers.
- ✅ Logging and observability:
  - Central `logs/` with timestamped runs, plus a summary CSV per session (albums processed, errors, durations).
- ✅ Safety/keys:
  - Move API keys and toggles to environment variables (`.env` pattern) and reference them in scripts.
  - Missing API keys should degrade gracefully (skip that lookup source) rather than crashing the run.

### Remaining enhancements:
- `generate_checksums.sh` — writes/verifies `SHA256SUMS` in each album folder.
- `embed_cover_art.py` — embeds `cover.jpg` into FLACs (idempotent).
- Add env support to scripts and document `.env.sample`.

## Phase 2 — Library health and dedup
- Health checks:
  - Walk the library and validate: tag completeness, presence of `cover.jpg`, filename conformity, playlist freshness.
  - Report-only mode vs. `--fix` mode.
- Deduplication:
  - Duplicate detection via normalized path+tags; optionally via acoustic fingerprinting (`fpcalc`/Chromaprint) for FLACs.
- Unicode/FS normalization:
  - Enforce NFC normalization on filenames; unify whitespace and dash conventions.

Deliverables:
- `audit_library.py` — generates a HTML/CSV report (missing tags/covers, nonconforming names, duplicates).
- `dedupe_library.py` — identifies (& optionally resolves) duplicates safely.

## Phase 3 — Video discs (DVD/Blu‑ray) ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: Core workflow implemented and battle-tested.

### Completed features:
- ✅ Unified `bin/rip_video.sh` — MakeMKV + HandBrakeCLI wrapper with:
  - Auto-detection of DVD vs Blu-ray discs (via `drutil` and `makemkvcon`)
  - Title-based or date-based staging folders
  - Automatic organization to `Movies/Title (Year)/` structure
  - Configurable minimum title length filtering (`MINLENGTH`)
- ✅ Audio/subtitle language handling:
  - Interactive prompts for non-English audio (prefer English audio, add English subs, or keep as-is)
  - Policy-based automation via `AUDIO_SUBS_POLICY` (prefer-audio, prefer-subs, prefer-burned, keep)
  - Automatic burn-in of English image-based subtitles (VobSub/PGS) for non-English audio when no soft subs available
  - **Fixed**: HandBrake track numbering calculation (uses sequential position, not stream index)
  - Post-mux of English text-based subtitles (SubRip/ASS/SSA/WebVTT) into MP4
- ✅ Backfill helper (`bin/backfill_subs.sh`) — mux English soft subs from MKV into existing MP4 without re-encoding
- ✅ OCR support for image-based subtitles:
  - Automatic extraction and OCR using Subtitle Edit + Tesseract (when tools available)
  - Manual OCR workflow with `vobsub-to-srt` helper for placeholder SRT creation
- ✅ Makefile integration:
  - `make install-video-deps` — one-command setup for all video tools
  - `make rip-video` / `make rip-movie` — streamlined ripping workflows
  - `make backfill-subs` — subtitle backfilling
- Comprehensive documentation in `docs/video_ripping_guide.md`

### Remaining enhancements:
- ✅ Metadata fetching via TMDb/OMDb for tagging MP4 movie files (`bin/tag-movie-metadata.py`)
- HDR10/SDR tone mapping strategies for UHD content
- TV series episode detection and naming automation

Dependencies (installed via `make install-video-deps`): `makemkv`, `handbrakecli`, `ffmpeg`, `mkvtoolnix`, `jq`, `tesseract`.

## Phase 4 — Orchestration and UX
- Unified CLI:
  - `media_cli.py` — a single entrypoint to run rip/normalize/audit/compare flows with subcommands.
- Config management:
  - `media.yml` config for paths, quality presets, account keys; environment overrides.
- Queues and parallelization:
  - Batch mode for multiple discs/albums; parallel cover downloads; safe concurrency controls.

## Phase 5 — Media server readiness
- Target servers: Plex, Jellyfin, Emby (select later).
- Library layout under a common root, e.g., `/Volumes/Data/Media/`:
  - `Music/Artist/Album/NN - Title.flac`
  - `Movies/Movie Name (Year)/Movie Name (Year).mkv`
  - `TV/Show Name/Season 01/Show Name - S01E01 - Episode Title.mkv`
- Integrity and backup:
  - Maintain checksums and a backup plan (local + offsite).
  - Periodic re-scan jobs and health reports.

### Explicit content policy
- Maintain `EXPLICIT=Yes|No|Unknown` tags on the source archive.
- Sync to downstream servers with an explicit policy (e.g., exclude `Yes`, optionally exclude `Unknown`).

## Open technical questions
- Do we prefer embedded artwork in FLACs or external-only? Some servers prefer both.
- What default CRF/resolution for BD vs. DVD? Separate presets for mobile vs. TV playback?
- UHD/HDR handling: tone mapping vs. HDR10 pass-through strategies.
- Handling multi-disc albums, box sets, and bonus materials.

## Legal and usage note
All tools and processes here are for making copies of media you own for local, personal use only. Respect the laws of your jurisdiction, disc decryption rules, and API terms for metadata services.
